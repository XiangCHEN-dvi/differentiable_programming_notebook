Differentiable Programming Notebook
===================================

A repository to record notes on `Differentiable Programming <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/differentiable_programming>`_.

We believe that differentiable programming is the key to bridge physics-driven modeling and data-driven modeling, where physics priors are natively embedded in a "neural network" without affecting the end-to-end model differentiation, so that the model performs better in data efficiency, generalization ability, and interpretability.

The notebook consists of three major components, Automatic Differentiation, Implicit Gradient, and Differentiable Physics Models, each stacking on the previous ones.

The notebook is hosted on readthedocs.
