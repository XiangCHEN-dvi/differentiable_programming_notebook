Differentiable Programming Notebook
===================================

A repository to record notes on `Differentiable Programming <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/differentiable_programming>`.

We believe that differentiable programming is the key to bridge physics-driven modeling and data-driven modeling, where physics models are embedded without affecting the end-to-end model differentiation, so that the model performs better in data efficiency, optimization efficiency, generalization ability, and interpretability.
